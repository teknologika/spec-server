# Task Breakdown

This document lists the tactical, step-by-step tasks required to complete the current objective from `PLANNING.MD`. Assistants should use this as their primary work log.

## How to Use

1.  At the start of a work session, copy the current objective from `PLANNING.MD` into the `Current Objective` section below.
2.  Break down the objective into a checklist of small, concrete tasks.
3.  Mark tasks as complete (`- [x]`) as you finish them.
4.  Add new tasks as they are discovered.
5.  Once all tasks are complete, update `PLANNING.MD` and select the next objective.
