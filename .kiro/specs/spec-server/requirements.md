# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using FastMCP that provides structured feature development capabilities through a three-phase workflow: Requirements → Design → Implementation Tasks. The server will enable AI assistants to create, manage, and execute feature specifications in a systematic way, transforming rough ideas into executable implementation plans.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an AI assistant, I want to create new feature specifications, so that I can systematically plan complex features before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to create a new spec THEN the system SHALL create a new spec directory with the format `/specs/{feature_name}/`
2. WHEN creating a new spec THEN the system SHALL generate an initial requirements.md file with proper EARS format
3. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL include user stories and acceptance criteria based on the user's input
4. IF a spec directory already exists THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the spec already exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage the three-phase workflow (Requirements → Design → Tasks), so that I can ensure proper progression through the specification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in requirements phase THEN the system SHALL only allow progression to design phase after explicit approval
2. WHEN in design phase THEN the system SHALL only allow progression to tasks phase after explicit approval
3. WHEN user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL update the current document and request approval again
4. IF user requests changes to a previous phase THEN the system SHALL allow returning to that phase
5. WHEN a phase is incomplete THEN the system SHALL prevent skipping to later phases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create comprehensive design documents, so that I have a clear technical plan before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating design document THEN the system SHALL include sections for Overview, Architecture, Components and Interfaces, Data Models, Error Handling, and Testing Strategy
2. WHEN generating design THEN the system SHALL base content on the approved requirements document
3. WHEN design requires research THEN the system SHALL conduct and incorporate research findings
4. IF design document doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it before allowing task creation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate actionable implementation tasks, so that I can execute the feature development incrementally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating tasks THEN the system SHALL format them as numbered checkboxes with maximum two-level hierarchy
2. WHEN generating tasks THEN the system SHALL ensure each task involves writing, modifying, or testing code only
3. WHEN creating tasks THEN the system SHALL reference specific requirements from the requirements document
4. WHEN generating tasks THEN the system SHALL focus on incremental, test-driven development
5. IF tasks include non-coding activities THEN the system SHALL reject and regenerate without those activities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute individual tasks from the implementation plan, so that I can work through the feature development systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a task THEN the system SHALL read all three spec documents (requirements, design, tasks)
2. WHEN executing a task THEN the system SHALL focus only on the specified task
3. WHEN a task has sub-tasks THEN the system SHALL start with sub-tasks first
4. WHEN task execution is complete THEN the system SHALL update task status and stop
5. IF user doesn't specify a task THEN the system SHALL recommend the next unstarted task

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage spec files and their states, so that I can track progress and make updates as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing specs THEN the system SHALL show all existing specs with their current phase status
2. WHEN reading spec files THEN the system SHALL return the current content of requirements, design, or tasks documents
3. WHEN updating spec files THEN the system SHALL modify the specified document while maintaining format
4. WHEN deleting specs THEN the system SHALL remove the entire spec directory and contents
5. IF spec files are missing THEN the system SHALL indicate which files need to be created

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file reference support in spec documents, so that I can integrate external specifications and schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spec documents contain file references THEN the system SHALL support `#[[file:<relative_file_name>]]` syntax
2. WHEN processing file references THEN the system SHALL resolve and include referenced file content
3. WHEN file references are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. IF referenced files don't exist THEN the system SHALL indicate missing dependencies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to interact with the specs server through standard MCP tools, so that I can integrate with any MCP-compatible AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP client connects THEN the server SHALL expose all spec management tools
2. WHEN tools are called THEN the server SHALL validate parameters and return appropriate responses
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the server SHALL return structured error messages with helpful details
4. WHEN server starts THEN the server SHALL be discoverable through standard MCP protocol
5. IF invalid tool calls are made THEN the server SHALL return clear validation errors
